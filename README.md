# voice-hearing-stigma
This repository contains [data](religiousness_stigma_voice_hearing_data.csv) from Peter Phalen's doctoral dissertation, as well as [one of the measures developed for the dissertation](Causal_Beliefs_Questionnaire-Revised.docx). 

Results have been reported in [Phalen, Warman, Martin, & Lysaker (2018)](Phalen-et-al-2018.pdf) and [Phalen, Warman, Martin, Lucksted, Drapalski, Jones, & Lysaker (in press)](Phalen-et-al-in-press.pdf). In the process of working on the "in press" article, we received IRB approval to publicly release the underlying data used for the analyses, which we include as a .csv file [here](religiousness_stigma_voice_hearing_data.csv). 

The .csv file only includes the data that was used for the analyses publised in Phalen et al (in press), as opposed to including all the measures we collected. However, we also possess data on the following questionnaires:

* Brief Multidimensional Measure of Religiousness/Spirituality (BMMRS)
* Santa Clara Strength of Religious Faith Questionnaire (SCSRFQ)
* Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA)
* Level-of-Contact Report (LoCR)
* Peters et al. Delusions Inventory-21 (PDI-21)
* Launay-Slade Hallucinations Scale (LSHS)
* Childhood Life Events Scale (CLES; Petti et al., 2004)
* Self-transcendence (TCI-125 self-transcendence subscale; Cloninger, 1993)
* Thought Action Fusion Questionnaire-Revised (Shafran, Thordasron, & Rachman, 1996)

In addition, we had participants read vignettes describing people who heard different kinds of voices (positive versus negative voices; religious versus non-religious voices), and with respect to each vignette we presented participants with the following measures:
* Social Distance Scale (Link, Cullen, Frank, & Wozniak, 1987) 
* Perceived Dangerousness Scale (Link, Cullen, Frank, & Wozniak, 1987) 
* [Causal Belief Questionnaireâ€“Revised/Religion](Causal_Beliefs_Questionnaire-Revised.docx) (see [Phalen et al., in press](Phalen-et-al-in-press.pdf))
* Two items asking participants about whether the voice was caused by "mental illness" or "schizophrenia"
